# company-box

[![CI](https://github.com/elp-revive/company-box/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/elp-revive/company-box/actions/workflows/test.yml)

A company front-end with icons.

![company-box](etc/company-box.png)

Differences with the built-in front-end:

- Differents colors for differents backends.
- Icons associated to functions/variables/.. and their backends
- Display candidate's documentation (support `quickhelp-string`)
- Not limited by the current window size, buffer's text properties, .. (it's better than you might think)

This package requires emacs 26.
Also, not compatible with emacs in a tty.
